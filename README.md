# Gladiator-Arena---University-Project

Submission for my university project for the class COMP603 Program design and construction; at Auckland University of Technology.

The project was set to private until now, that grades have been released.

This project is a display of many object oriented programming practises and designs, and not necessarily a well balanced game.

Includes:
* Polymorphism
* Singleton design patterns
* Derby embedded database
* File I/O
* Multi-threading
* Interactive GUI
